## Introduction:
‘Semantic Spotter - Project’, where we supposed to use either LangChain or LlamaIndex frameworks to solve an end-to-end problem statement.
## Objectives: 
The goal of the project is to build a robust generative search system capable of effectively and accurately answering questions from the loaded various insurance policy documents.
We are using LlamaIndex to build the generative search application.
## Design: 
The project involves multiple layers of communication right from loading the document, creating the indexes (Vector Store Index, Summary Index) out of it at respective nodes. Retrieving the information as per the user query which performs semantic search and retrieve the data. Again the retrieved information will be processed through ranking (scores) and display the appropriate answer as response.
## Implementation: 
The implementation involved below main steps as mentioned below 
  1. Data loading,
  2. Nodes Parsing and build the Indices (Vector Store Index, Summary Index)
  3. Construction of Query engine
  4. Response
