No Policy of Life Insurance shall be called in question on any ground whatsoever after expiry of 3 yrs \\nfrom  \\na. the date of issuance of policy or  \\nb. the date of commencement of risk or  \\nc. the date of revival of policy or  \\nd. the date of rider to the policy  \\nwhichever is later.  \\n2. On the ground of fraud, a policy of Life Insurance may be called in question within 3 years from  \\na. the date of issuance of policy or  \\nb. the date of commencement of risk or  \\nc. the date of revival of policy or  \\nd. the date of rider to the policy  \\nwhichever is later.  \\nFor this, the insurer should communicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or \\nassignees of insured, as applicable, mentioning the ground and materials on which such decision is based.  \\n3. Fraud means any of the following acts committed by insured or by his agent, with the intent to deceive the \\ninsurer or to induce the insurer to issue a life insurance policy:  \\na. The suggestion, as a fact of that which is not true and which the insured does not believe to be true;  \\nb. The active concealment of a fact by the insured having knowledge or belief of the fact;  \\nc. Any other act fitted to deceive; and  \\nd. Any such act or omission as the law specifically declares to be fraudulent.  \\n4. Mere silence is not fraud unless, depending on circumstances of the case, it is the duty of the insured or his \\nagent keeping silence to speak or silence is in itself equivalent to speak.  \\n5. No Insurer shall repudiate a life insurance Policy on the ground of Fraud, if the Insured / beneficiary can \\nprove that the misstatement was true to the best of his knowledge and there was no deliberate intention to \\nsuppress the fact or that such mis-statement of or suppression of material fact are within the knowledge of \\nthe insurer. Onus of disproving is upon the policyholder, if alive, or beneficiaries.  \\n6. Life insurance Policy can be called in question within 3 years on the ground that any statement of or \\nsuppression of a fact material to expectancy of life of the insured was incorrectly made in the proposal or \\nother document basis which policy was issued or revived or rider issued. For this, the insurer should \\ncommunicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as \\napplicable, mentioning the ground and materials on which decision to repudiate the policy of life insurance \\nis based.  \\n7. In case repudiation is on ground of mis-statement and not on fraud, the premium collected on policy till \\nthe date of repudiation shall be paid to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of \\ninsured, within a period of 90 days from the date of repudiation.  \\n8. Fact shall not be considered material unless it has a direct bearing on the risk undertaken by the insurer. \\nThe onus is on insurer to show that if the insurer had been aware of the said fact, no life insurance policy \\nwould have been issued to the insured.  \\n9. The insurer can call for proof of age at any time if he is entitled to do so and no policy shall be deemed to \\nbe called in question merely because the terms of the policy are adjusted on subsequent proof of age of life \\ninsured. So, this Section will not be applicable for questioning age or adjustment based on proof of age \\nsubmitted subsequently.  \\n \\nDisclaimer: This is only the relevant extract of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015.

No Policy  of Life Insurance shall be called in question on any ground whatsoever after expiry of 3 years from  \\na. the date o f issuance of Policy  or \\nb. the date of commencement of risk or  \\nc. the date of revival of Policy  or \\nd. the date of rider to the Policy  \\nwhichever is later.  \\n \\n02. On the ground of fraud, a Policy  of Life Insurance may be called in question within 3 years from  \\na. the date of issuance of Policy  or \\nb. the date of commencement of risk or  \\nc. the date of revival of Policy  or \\nd. the date of rider to the Policy  \\nwhichever is later.  \\n \\nFor this, the insurer should communicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees \\nof insured, as applicable, mentioning the ground and materials on which such decision is based.  \\n \\n03. Fraud means any of the following acts committed by insured or by his agent, with the intent to deceive the \\ninsurer o r to induce the insurer to issue a life insurance Policy : \\n \\na. The suggestion, as a fact of that which is not true and which the insured does not believe to be true;  \\nb. The active concealment of a fact by the insured having knowledge or belief of the fact;  \\nc. Any other act fitted to deceive; and  \\nd. Any such act or omission as the law specifically declares to be fraudulent.  \\n \\n04. Mere silence is not fraud unless, depending on circumstances of the case, it is the duty of the insured or his \\nagent keeping silence  to speak or silence is in itself equivalent to speak.  \\n \\n05. No Insurer shall repudiate a life insurance Policy  on the ground of Fraud, if the Insured / claimant can prove \\nthat the misstatement was true to the best of his knowledge and there was no delibera te intention to suppress the \\nfact or that such misstatement of or suppression of material fact are within the knowledge of the insurer. Onus of \\ndisproving is upon the Policyholder , if alive, or claimant.  \\n \\n06. Life insurance Policy  can be called in question  within 3 years on the ground that any statement of or \\nsuppression of a fact material to expectancy of life of the insured was incorrectly made in the master proposal  \\nform or other document basis which Policy  was issued or revived or rider issued. For this , the insurer should \\ncommunicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as applicable, \\nmentioning the ground and materials on which decision to repudiate the Policy  of life insurance is based.  \\n \\n07. In case rep udiation is on ground of misstatement and not on fraud, the Premium  collected on Policy  till the \\ndate of repudiation shall be paid to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, within \\na period of 90 days from the date of repudi ation.  \\n \\n08. Fact shall not be considered material unless it has a direct bearing on the risk undertaken by the insurer. The \\nonus is on insurer to show that if the insurer had been aware of the said fact, no life insurance Policy  would have \\nbeen issued to t he insured.  \\n \\n09. The insurer can call for proof of age at any time if he is entitled to do so and no Policy  shall be deemed to be \\ncalled in question merely because the terms of the Policy  are adjusted on subsequent proof of age of life insured. \\nSo, this Se ction will not be applicable for questioning age or adjustment based on proof of age submitted \\nsubsequently.  \\n \\n[Disclaimer: This is not a comprehensive list of amendments.

Any such act or omission as the law specifically declares to be fraudulent.  \\n4) Mere silence is n ot fraud unless, depending on circumstances of the case, it is the duty of the insured or his \\nagent keeping silence to speak or silence is in itself equivalent to speak.  \\n5) No Insurer shall repudiate a life insurance Policy on the ground of Fraud, if the Ins ured / beneficiary can \\nprove that the misstatement was true to the best of his knowledge and there was no deliberate intention to \\nsuppress the fact or that such mis -statement of or suppression of material fact are within the knowledge of \\nthe insurer. Onus of disproving is upon the policyholder, if alive, or beneficiaries.  \\n6) Life insurance Policy can be called in question within 3 years on the ground that any statement of or \\nsuppression of a fact material to expectancy of life of the insured was incorrectly m ade in the proposal or \\nother document basis which policy was issued or revived or rider issued. For this, the insurer should \\ncommunicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as \\napplicable, mentioning the gro und and materials on which decision to repudiate the policy of life insurance \\nis based.  \\n7) In case repudiation is on ground of mis -statement and not on fraud, the premium collected on policy till the \\ndate of repudiation shall be paid to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, \\nwithin a period of 90 days from the date of repudiation.  \\n8) Fact shall not be considered material unless it has a direct bearing on the risk undertaken by the insurer. The \\nonus is on insurer to show that if the insurer had been aware of the said fact, no life insurance policy would \\nhave been issued to the insured.  \\n9) The insurer can call for proof of age at any time if he is entitled to do so and no policy shall be deemed to be \\ncalled in question merely because  the terms of the policy are adjusted on subsequent proof of age of life \\ninsured. So, this Section will not be applicable for questioning age or adjustment based on proof of age \\nsubmitted subsequently.  \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
